            <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Adventure in life, most of the time is planned in the form of sports or other thrilling activities; though, sometimes it might also come as a complete surprise. Whether accidental or planned, adventure most of the time offers thrilling and overall pleasing experience; though, exceptions do exist. Below provided is a brief description of the types of adventures you can experience in your life.
                <br> <br>
                For instance, just suppose that you went to see an ailing relative residing in another town, say a couple of miles away. You got late and were able to start your return journey only after sundown. Since you were running late, you decided to take a shortcut that runs through a forest, to save a few miles and of course time. Just when you are halfway through the dense forest, suddenly you realize that the car started pulling to one side of the road.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Going mountain biking is one of my favourite ways of keeping fit and keeping my weekends busy. In particular mountain biking down hills and nature parks is my favourite pastime. When riding down trails in wooded areas, one must always be cautious of their own safety and become accustomed to wearing the right gear for when doing the trails. As much as they may seem exciting and wild to be involved with, it makes sense to be prepared to protect yourself.

                Mountain biking holidays are simply breaks away and trying out their trails. Some places can be as exotic as Andalucia, Spain or South Africa. These offer great views, good trails and plenty of bikes to hire (unless you decide to take your own). People do not generally need a lot of experience to take part in these kinds of holidays; however, it helps to have some off-road biking experience and some trail riding experience.

                <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Mischief in Patagonia is a great book about Tilman’s 1950’s sailing and climbing voyage in a boat of the same name. Reading it there is a comparison between coastal yachtsmen and ocean going sailors (buggered if I can find it!!), which reminded me a bit of the parallels between typical paraglider pilots and myself. The gist of it was that while yachtsmen may be more skilful to navigate around coves, inlets and headlands, there is some satisfaction particular to crossing an ocean, and heading off into uncharted territory.
                <br> <br>
                Although I know of several New Zealander’s who became interested in paragliding because of their mountain connections (as I did), the sport is predominantly flying related, and the only climbs anyone would consider involve circling in a thermal. This is a shame because paragliders are perfectly suited to mountain travel. The kit is of similar weight to a rope and a tent, and potentially, could even be substituted for both. It can be packed in minutes and set up is even faster, and with practice take off and landing can be done in very tight spaces.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Many people say surfing isn’t a sport, it’s a lifestyle – but, it’s more than that. From the moment you first step in the ocean to the day you die it is a part of you. It becomes the way you think and what plays across your mind when you are in that subconscious state between awake and asleep. It has an affair with your emotions and embeds itself in the depths of your heart. You cannot get rid of the ocean once it’s made its mark on you
                <br> <br>
                There are over 17 to 27 million surfer’s world wide, and about 10 to 15 million skimboarders. Surfing is the term used for a surface water sport in which the person surfing moves along the face of a breaking ocean wave. Skimboarding is a board sport in which a skim board (a smaller, sleeker version of a surfboard) is used to ride on an incoming wave. Clearly people choose more to surf than to skim. I want to know why more people are surfing than skimming for such a large margin. Perhaps the answer is in danger of them, the style or on the price of the boards used.
